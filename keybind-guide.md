# How to customize keybinds in Beyond All Reason 

Keybinds in BAR are handled differently than most games, having no built-in keybind editor. This can be cumbersome and annoying, but with the expansiveness of the keybind capabilities, it is hard to build a UI for editing it that comes close to capturing the full capabilities.

To use custom keybind files, you need to edit a text file, specifically one called `uikeys.txt`

## Setting up a custom keybind file

- Open the launcher and click on "Open Installation Directory."
- Open "data" folder (not necessary on Linux systems). This is where the custom keybind config file, `uikeys.txt`, will  live.
- In-game (singleplayer skirmish against InactiveAI), first choose the preset you want to customize from Settings -> Control -> Keybindings
- Then from Settings -> Control -> Keybindings, select "Custom" from the drop-down and the game will create a `uikeys.txt` for you to edit with your favorite text editor. This first version of your custom file is based on the last preset you had chosen.
  - We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [`uikeys` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nbusseneau.vscode-uikeys), for syntax highlighting and completion suggestions.
- To test your changes in real time: Type `/keyreload` after you have saved additional changes to your `uikeys.txt`.
